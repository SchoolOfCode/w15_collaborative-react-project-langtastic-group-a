# About Langtastic
Langtastic was created by: Muna Fidow, Ines Perez and Toby Smith and Jubair Ahmed. 

Langtastic is a web app designed to connect language learners to tutors. The platform allows users to book and manage appointments, and find a new tutor should they wish to learn a new language or switch tutors. 

## Home Page

The homepage shows information about learning a new language, help with finding a tutor and some reviews of the site. 
COMING SOON - log in or sign up to review/add lesson bookings!

## Dashboard

The dashboard allows the user to see any past and upcoming appointments, who they are with, and the time and data. 

## Tutor Selection

The tutor selection page allows the user to find a new tutor and book an appointment with them. 

## Appointment Confirmation

The appointment confirmation page gives the user a summary of their proposed booking before letting them confirm.
