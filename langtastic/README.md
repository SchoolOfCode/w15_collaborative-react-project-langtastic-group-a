# About Langtastic
Langtastic was created by: Muna Fidow, Ines Perez and Toby Smith and Jubair Ahmed. 

Langtastic is a web app designed to connect language learners to tutors. The platform allows users to book and manage appointments, and find a new tutor should they wish to learn a new language or switch tutors. 

## Home Page

The homepage shows information about learning a new language, help with finding a tutor and some reviews of the site. 
COMING SOON - log in or sign up to review/add lesson bookings!

## Dashboard

The dashboard allows the user to see any past and upcoming appointments, who they are with, and the time and data. 

## Tutor Selection

The tutor selection page allows the user to find a new tutor and book an appointment with them. 

## Appointment Confirmation

The appointment confirmation page gives the user a summary of their proposed booking before letting them confirm.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
